This script is to remote control the ET4510 LCR meter as well as a Omega CN740 temperature controller. 
LCR part was revised from John Albert Faccinto's script @ https://github.com/TheDuckenEngineer

[Oct 13th 2025] Temp controller part will be updated soon. 
- Omega CN740 is controlled via ASCII hexadecimal format.
- New functions for CN740 has been added. 
    DeviceConnect_CN740(), calc_lrc(), PIDDataReadout(), PIDcommander(), Experiment2(), DataExport2()
- New script in Jupyter Notebook to measure temperature dependence measurement at a fixed frequency.

For MAC user, the argument for DeviceConenct() is different from the original file.
