# Introduction
This script is to remote control the ET4510 LCR meter as well as a PID controller. 
LCR part was revised from my labmate John Albert Faccinto's script @ https://github.com/TheDuckenEngineer
PID part will be updated. 

For MAC user, the argument for DeviceConenct is different. 
Check the usb serial in System Information > USB

[Example] ser_lcr = DeviceConnect('/dev//cu.usbserial-A94IP9Y2')  # LCR Meter
